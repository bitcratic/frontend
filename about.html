     	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

     	<p>This guide will help you to understand Bitcratic and use it properly. Bitcratic is a semi decentralized exchange where majority of the operation being handled by the Blockchain which allows traders to remain owner of their token and enable the whole system to deal with money transfers and execute trades without any hassle.  Bitcratic use off-chain order book with On-chain settlement.</p>
        
        <div class="smtitle">What is a Decentralized Exchange?</div>
        <p>Unlike centralized exchange, decentralized exchange allows traders to control over their tokens. Simply put, traders don’t need to depend on central authority for trading. In decentralized exchange trading occurs between buyers and sellers in a peer-to-peer network via an automated process. Where centralized exchanges have loopholes like hacking, losing customer’s fund, and server downtime; the same decentralized exchange eliminates these risks.  That’s why decentralized exchange consider better than centralized exchange.</p>
         <div class="smtitle">The difference between Centralized and Decentralized exchange</div>
         <ul class="orderlist">
        	<li>In centralized exchange users don’t have complete authority over their funds. The decentralized exchange allows user to control their funds completely. </li>
            <li>Where centralized exchange is easy to use the same decentralized exchange is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Users remain anonymous in the decentralized exchange but in centralized exchange it is not possible.  </li>
            <li>In the centralized exchange, since data remain store in a single server so it is vulnerable and easy to hack. On the other side in the decentralized system data don’t remain store in a single server, rather data stored in thousands of computers so almost impossible to hack.  </li>
            <li>Where centralized exchange is fast and advanced the same decentralized exchange is not fast and advanced. Research is going on to make this system better. </li>
            <li>Where centralized exchange ensures high liquidity the same decentralized exchange does not offer such flexibility.  </li>

        <p>To create wallet go to top right corner of Bitcratic and select “select account”. In the drop down menu either you can create a new account (Ether wallet address) or import an existing one (including Meta mask). Although there is not really big difference between two, but it is advisable to create a new wallet and send some Ethereum from your other wallet to new Bitcratic wallet. </p>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Step 3: Verify Wallet Add</div>
        <p>Before start trading verify your wallet address. Make sure that your wallet address is correctly linked up. You can verify that your ether address has a balance by checking the top right corner.You can further verify by going to the top left corner of the screen where you can see “deposit”, “withdrawal”, “token”, “wallet” etc.  Click on the “wallet” and you will see your linked wallet’s ether balance.</p>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Step 4: Buy/ Sell tokens</div>
        <p>Once you have Ether in your account then you can start trading and buy/sell tokens. Go to the dropdown menu at the top left corner, near Bitcratic logo. Click on it, you will see 3-4 letter combinations. These are tokens. Choose the token according to your wish and click on it. Once you click on it, you will be redirected to a page and it will appear something like this. </p>
        <p>To execute a buy or sell order, go to the module that says “New Order”listed in the middle bottom half of the screen.Here you can follow the process. </p>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Step 5: Wait for order to execute </div>

     	<div class="smtitle">1-	How gas (transaction) fees work</div>
        <p>Gas fees include in every transaction, which will be paid to miners on the Ethereum network. On BitCratic, Ethereum transactions are required for depositing, withdrawing, and trading.</p>
        <p>If you are using BitCratic with MetaMask then you can lower the gas price in case of accepting a transaction. Bitcratic recommends a gas fee of 4 gwei if you don’t mind waiting a few blocks for your transaction to confirm. If you are using Bitcratic without MetaMask, the gas price is fixed at 4 gwei.</p>
        <div class="smtitle">2-	How to start using BitCratic? </div>
        <div class="subtitle">Steps to get started with BitCratic using MetaMask</div>
        <ul class="orderlist">
        	<li>Open Google Chrome.</li>
            <li>Install MetaMask, click on the link https://metamask.io/and then click on “Get Chrome Extension”  </li>
            <li>Users remain anonymous in the decentralized exchange but in centralized exchange it is not possible.  </li>
            <li>According to the instruction of MetaMask, write down the recovery phase and store it in some safe and secure place.  Don’t skip this step. </li>
            <li>Ensure that you are logged into MetaMask. </li>
            <li>Refresh BitCratic.com</li>
            <li>Your MetaMask account address should appear in the BitCratic account automatically at the upper right in the dropdown. If it doesn’t, then something has gone wrong. If you have another Ethereum plugin, then go to Window -> Extension and disable it. </li>
            <li>Select your MetaMask account from the account dropdown (upper right).</li>
		</ul>
        <div class="subtitle">How to get started without MetaMask: </div>
        <p>In case, if you are not comfortable with Google Chrome and MetaMask, then you can still use BitCratic. BitCratic will store your address and private key in the browser.  Your address and private key will not be stored on or sent to a server. This guide will explain you to get started. </p>
        <ul class="orderlist">
        	<li>Open Google Chrome and go to BitCratic.com</li>
            <li>If you have MetaMask or other Ethereum plugin, go to window ->Extensions and disable them. Then refresh BitCratic. </li>
            <li>Users remain anonymous in the decentralized exchange but in centralized exchange it is not possible.  </li>
            <li>In case, if you already have an Ethereum account, go to the account dropdown (upper right), select "Import account."Enter your address and private key. You will get an error, if you enter wrong private key address.</li>
            <li>In case, if you want to create a new Ethereum account, then go to the account dropdown (upper right) and select “New account”, enter your private key that has been generated for you and store it in a safe and secure place.  </li>
		</ul>
        
        
         <div class="smtitle">3- How to deposit, withdraw, and transfer:</div>
         <div class="subtitle">Deposit</div>
         <p>Select an account in the account dropdown which is at the upper right.  Your account should be managed by either MetaMask or BitCratic’s browser wallet. You can see you wallet balance next to your account address. If zero balance in the wallet then you need to send some ETH to your wallet address.  Do that before proceeding to the next step. </p>
         <p>Now some ETH in your wallet, deposit ether from your wallet to the BitCratic smart contract so that you can start trading. In the upper left, you can see balance section. There are three columns, “deposit”, “withdraw” and “transfer.” The “deposit” column shows the balance held in the account you have selected in the account dropdown. </p>
         <p>When you deposit fund then it moves from your “wallet” to the BitCratic exchange smart contract.  To do this enter the amount and click “deposit.” Make sure that you are not depositing all of your Ethereum; keep some Ethereum to cover gas fees. Generally leaving 0.05 ETH in the wallet considers good and it covers gas fee for future transactions (trading, depositing, and withdrawing.)   </p>
         <p>
         In case if you are using MetaMask, then transaction approval takes some time. If you are not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the “Gas price” item in the account dropdown, which is located at the upper right. 
         <p>
         <strong>NOTE:</strong> In case if you are depositing a token (not ETH), then you have to do two consecutive transactions. The first transactions will approve the BitCratic smart contract to transfer the deposit on your behalf and the second will be the actual deposit. It is mandatory to approve the both.  
         </p>
         <p>
         After confirmation BitCratic will tell you that you generated a transaction. You can click on the provided link to track your transaction. 
         </p>
        <div class="subtitle">Withdraw:</div>
        <p>The Withdraw tab is the opposite of the Deposit tab. It will move funds from the "BitCratic" column back to the "Wallet" column.</p> 
         </p>
         
         <div class="subtitle">Transfer:</div>
        <p>If you want to transfer funds to another address, then there is transfer tab next to the withdraw tab at the upper left. The deposit tab moves funds from your wallet to BitCratic. The </p>
        
        <p>withdraw tab moves funds from BitCratic to your wallet. The transfer tab moves funds from your wallet to another wallet address. </p>
        <p>On the transfer tab, the first box is the amount which you want to transfer and the second box is the address you want to transfer to. Although, the address you want to transfer to is pre-filled in with your existing address. Remove this address, enter the address of your choice and then click on transfer.  </p>

         <div class="smtitle">4- How to trade </div>
         <p>How to trade (execute a trade, place an order, cancel an order) </p>
         <ul class="orderlist">
        	<li>Pick a token to trade. This guide will assume you have chosen PLU.</li>
            <li>Most tokens are listed in term of ETH. For example, a price of 0.03 PLU/ ETH means 1 PLU costs 0.03 ETH. </li>
            <li>In the order book you can see the green orders and red orders stacked on top of each other. Green orders are people who want to buy PLU and red orders are people who want to sell PLU. Click on red order to buy PLU, and click on green order to sell PLU. </li>
            <li>BitCratic will allow you to match one order per transaction. </li>
            <li>Partial fills are allowed. For example, if sell order is 100PLU then you can click the order and choose to trade only 25 PLU, leaving 75 PLU behind for someone else to trade. </li>
            <li>When you do a trade transaction will be generated.  </li>
            <li>In case, if more than one people try to trade the same order at once, the first transaction to be confirmed will get the trade.  </li>
             <li>You will get error in case of failed trade, but your fund will remain safe. Only a gas charges will be deducted.   </li>
		</ul>
        
        <div class="smtitle">How to place an order? </div>
        <ul class="orderlist">
            <li>You are free to place your own order, in case if you don’t want to trade immediately or don’t like the price you see in the order book. </li>
            <li>An order doesn’t involve a transaction. Here you have to sign a message, this mean there is no gas fee for placing orders.  </li>
            <li>If you want to buy or sell the token then select the buy tab or sell tab on the order form.   </li>
            <li>Let’s assume you want to buy a token.</li>
            <li>The first box is the amount of token, which you want to buy. </li>
            <li>The second box is the token price. </li>
            <li>The third box is the amount of token you will spend.  The box will populate automatically so you can confirm that the price you entered make sense.</li><li>The fourth box is the number of Ethereum blocks until your order expires automatically. The default, 10,000 is about two days. </li>
            <li>After submitting the order, you will see two small green bubbles pop up in the lower right. The first bubble is the indication of “you sent an order” and the second bubble is the indication of “ your order was received” </li>
            <li>You can see your order in the order book right after your order was received.  </li>
            <li>Your order will be highlighted in blue, so you can spot it easily.</li>
            <li>The order book will only show top 100 buy and sell order. If your order is not in top 100 then it will not display, but it will appear if enough orders trade. </li>
            <li>BitCratic does not do order matching. For example, if someone is offering token for sale at 0.03, you can place an order to buy for a price of 0.04, trading is not automatic. If you wish to trade then click an order and trade.</li>
            <li>The balance will not change when you place an order, balance will change when you trade an order. </li>
        </ul>
        
        
         <div class="smtitle">How to cancel an order </div>
        <ul class="orderlist">
            <li>Click on order tab, which is under “ My Transaction” </li>
            <li>Find your order in the order list and then press cancel. </li>
